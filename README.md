# Writing good documentation

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks.

**Codeblocks in markdown makes it very easy for tech people to copy, paste, share code,**

A _good cloud engineer_ uses Codeblocks whenever possible.

```
# This is a comment.

# Define a method called "hello_world" that takes no arguments
# and prints "Hello, world!" to the console.
def hello_world
  puts "Hello, world!"
end

# Call the "hello_world" method.
hello_world
```

To paste an image@
```
-- ![]()
```

or a link:
```
-- []()
```

Good cloud engineers use clodeblocks for bot Code and Errors that appear in the console.
``` bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "your_script.rb", line 3, in <main>
    puts empty_array[0]
IndexError: index 0 out of array
```
```
>
```
> Here is an example of using a clodeblock for an error that appear in bash.
